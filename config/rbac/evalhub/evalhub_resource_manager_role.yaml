# ClusterRole for EvalHub resource management
# This role is pre-created at operator installation time and bound to
# EvalHub proxy ServiceAccounts via RoleBindings created by the operator.
# This approach avoids giving the operator broad permissions that it would
# need to dynamically create Roles with these permissions.
